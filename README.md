# Project 7: Authenticated brevet time calculator service

This repository is built upon the previous iteration project, Brevet Flask API. This version has added security features utilizing authorization tokens and a new user profile database. Users must now register and log in to access the once before open API. The logged-in user is sent a session token which is verified at each API request.
